# Design Patterns : Strategy Pattern

In the last chapter, we’ve already turned a shitty, monolithic WhatsApp-like chat system into a SOLID-compliant beast. That’s no small feat, but let’s be real: it’s still got some chains holding it back. The **Strategy Pattern** is here to smash those fuckers, giving our code the flexibility to handle real-world chaos without breaking a sweat. This chapter rips into the flaws of our SOLID code, shows how Strategy makes it dynamic as hell, dives deep into the technical guts, and drops the full refactored code to prove it.

## Why Our SOLID Code Isn’t Enough
Our WhatsApp system is clean—SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP, all that good shit. But it’s still rigid in ways that’ll make us want to chuck our laptops out the window when requirements change. Here’s the mess we’re fixing:

- **Locked-in Behavior at Startup**: We inject `PushNotifier` or `EmailNotifier` into `MessageService` when it’s born, and that’s fucking it. Want to switch to SMS for admins or silence for do-not-disturb mode at runtime? We’re stuck rebuilding the whole damn service or juggling multiple instances. That’s a scalability nightmare.
- **Notification Logic is a Clusterfuck**: `PushNotifier` handles both new messages and mentions, while `EmailNotifier` only does mentions. Need push for messages and email for mentions? Or SMS for premium users? We’re screwed unless we write a new class like `PushAndSMSAndEmailNotifier`. That’s a one-way ticket to class-explosion hell.
- **Mention Extraction is Too Damn Rigid**: `RegexMentionService` works for basic `@username` matches, but what if we need fuzzy matching (`@johnd` → `@john_doe`) or AI-driven mention detection? We’re back to subclassing or rewriting, which smells like an OCP violation.
- **Unread Counting is Dumb as Dirt**: `SimpleUnreadService` just increments unread counts for everyone except the sender. Want to mute spammy users or only count “important” messages (like mentions or long texts)? We’re forking the class, duplicating code, and praying it doesn’t break.

These flaws aren’t catastrophic—yet. But they’re like a slow leak in our codebase: annoying now, fucking disastrous when we’re scaling to millions of users. The **Strategy Pattern** is the wrench that tightens this shit up, making our system dynamic, testable, and ready for whatever curveballs come next.

## What the Hell is the Strategy Pattern?
The Strategy Pattern is about **encapsulating behaviors** (like notifications or mention extraction) into swappable modules, so we can plug and play at runtime without touching the core code. It’s like giving our app a modular brain: swap out the notification “strategy” for a user who wants silence, or plug in a fuzzy mention parser for a group chat. No recompilation, no bullshit—just pure flexibility.

Here’s our playbook:
1. Define an **interface** (or abstract class) for a behavior (e.g., `NotificationStrategy`).
2. Create **concrete strategies** (e.g., `PushNotificationStrategy`, `SilentNotificationStrategy`).
3. Let our core service (`MessageService`) use the strategy and swap it out whenever we damn well please.

This pattern is our go-to when behaviors vary by user, context, or config, and we’re sick of `if-else` hell or subclassing everything to death.

## How Strategy Pattern Saves The Day
We’re applying Strategy to three pain points: **notifications**, **mention extraction**, and **unread counting**. For each, we’ll break down the fix, why it’s a win, and a technical deep dive to get into the nitty-gritty.

### 1. Notifications: From Static to Swappable
**Problem**: Our `MessageService` is chained to one `NewMessageNotifier` and `MentionNotifier` at startup. Switching to SMS or silencing notifications for a user mid-session? Good fucking luck—we need a new service instance or a rewrite.

**Fix**: Merge notification logic into a single `NotificationStrategy` interface with methods for both new messages and mentions. Implement flavors like:
- `PushNotificationStrategy`: Sends push notifications for everything.
- `EmailNotificationStrategy`: Emails for messages and mentions.
- `SilentNotificationStrategy`: Does jack shit (for muted users).
- `HybridNotificationStrategy`: Push for all, plus email for mentions if unread counts get high.

Add a `set_notification_strategy` method to `MessageService` for runtime swaps.

**Why It’s a Fucking Win**: We can change notification preferences on the fly—push for Alice, silence for Bob, email for Charlie. No need to rebuild the service or write a new class for every combo. Testing? Inject a mock strategy and call it a day. This keeps notification logic from turning into a spaghetti monster.

**Technical Deep Dive**:
- **Interface Design**: The `NotificationStrategy` abstract class defines two methods: `notify_new_message` and `notify_mention`. This consolidates the previous `NewMessageNotifier` and `MentionNotifier` interfaces, reducing interface bloat (ISP win) while maintaining clear contracts.
- **Implementation Details**: Each strategy (`Push`, `Email`, `Silent`, `Hybrid`) encapsulates a specific notification policy. `HybridNotificationStrategy` uses composition by checking `unread_count` against a threshold, showing how strategies can build on each other without class explosion.
- **SOLID Alignment**: Reinforces OCP (add new notification types like SMS without modifying `MessageService`) and DIP (depend on the `NotificationStrategy` abstraction, not concrete classes). The `set_notification_strategy` method enables runtime polymorphism, making our system adaptable to user preferences or server-side config changes.
- **Trade-offs**: Increases complexity slightly due to multiple strategy classes, but the flexibility outweighs this. Memory usage is negligible unless we’re creating thousands of strategy instances per user. For high-scale systems, we could pool strategies (e.g., singleton `PushNotificationStrategy`) to optimize.
- **Testing**: Mocking `NotificationStrategy` is trivial, allowing unit tests to verify behavior without hitting real notification systems. This makes integration testing a breeze compared to hardwired notifiers.

### 2. Mention Extraction: Beyond Basic Regex
**Problem**: `RegexMentionService` is fine for `@username`, but it’s rigid as hell. Need case-insensitive matches or fuzzy logic (`@johnd` → `@john_doe`)? We’re stuck subclassing or hacking the core, which screws with OCP.

**Fix**: Keep the `MentionExtractor` interface but add new strategies:
- `RegexMentionService`: Our original, exact-match logic.
- `CaseInsensitiveMentionExtractor`: Matches `@username` regardless of case.
- `FuzzyMentionExtractor`: Catches partial or typo-filled mentions.

Add a `set_mention_extractor` method to `MessageService` for runtime swaps.

**Why It’s a Fucking Win**: We can plug in new mention logic (e.g., AI-based detection for “yo Bob” mentions) without touching `MessageService`. It’s OCP-compliant, keeps our code clean, and makes adding new parsers a breeze.

**Technical Deep Dive**:
- **Interface Design**: The `MentionExtractor` abstract class defines a single `extract_mentions` method, keeping the contract lean (ISP). It takes `content` and `users` as inputs, returning a list of mentioned `User` objects.
- **Implementation Details**: `RegexMentionService` uses simple string matching for exact `@username`. `CaseInsensitiveMentionExtractor` lowers both content and usernames for comparison, handling case variations. `FuzzyMentionExtractor` adds partial matching, checking for usernames without the `@` prefix, which is useful for informal chats.
- **SOLID Alignment**: OCP is preserved since new extractors (e.g., `AIMentionExtractor`) can be added without modifying `MessageService`. DIP is maintained by depending on the `MentionExtractor` abstraction. LSP ensures all extractors can be swapped without breaking the system.
- **Trade-offs**: Fuzzy matching increases CPU usage slightly due to more complex string operations, but it’s negligible for most use cases. For performance-critical systems, we could cache mention results or optimize fuzzy logic with libraries like `fuzzywuzzy`. The runtime swap (`set_mention_extractor`) adds minor overhead but enables dynamic behavior (e.g., enabling fuzzy matching for group chats only).
- **Testing**: Mocking `MentionExtractor` allows testing mention logic in isolation. We can simulate edge cases (e.g., partial matches, ambiguous usernames) without real user data.

### 3. Unread Counting: Smarter Than “Increment Everything”
**Problem**: `SimpleUnreadService` blindly increments unread counts for all non-senders. Want to mute a spammy group or only count mentions? We’re forking the class and duplicating code like suckers.

**Fix**: Replace `UnreadCounter` with an `UnreadCountingStrategy` interface. Implementations include:
- `DefaultUnreadStrategy`: Our original logic—count for all non-senders.
- `MuteUnreadStrategy`: Skip muted users.
- `PriorityOnlyUnreadStrategy`: Only count “important” messages (mentions or long texts).

Add a `set_unread_strategy` method for runtime swaps.

**Why It’s a Fucking Win**: We can customize unread logic per user or chat. Mute a group? Done. Only count mentions? Easy. Swap strategies without breaking a sweat, and our code stays lean and mean.

**Technical Deep Dive**:
- **Interface Design**: `UnreadCountingStrategy` defines `increment_unread` and `get_unread_count`, ensuring a clear contract for managing unread counts. The `increment_unread` method takes the `message` parameter to allow content-based logic (e.g., checking for mentions).
- **Implementation Details**: `DefaultUnreadStrategy` mirrors the original `SimpleUnreadService`. `MuteUnreadStrategy` uses a `muted_user_ids` set to skip specific users, ideal for do-not-disturb settings. `PriorityOnlyUnreadStrategy` evaluates message content, counting only mentions or texts longer than 50 characters, which prioritizes meaningful notifications.
- **SOLID Alignment**: OCP is upheld since new strategies (e.g., `TeamBasedUnreadStrategy`) can be added without changing `MessageService`. DIP is maintained by depending on the `UnreadCountingStrategy` abstraction. LSP ensures all strategies work interchangeably.
- **Trade-offs**: `PriorityOnlyUnreadStrategy` adds a content check, which could slow down processing for very large messages, but this is minor unless we’re handling massive texts. The `muted_user_ids` set in `MuteUnreadStrategy` requires maintenance (e.g., updating when users leave a chat), but it’s a small price for flexibility. Runtime swaps add negligible overhead.
- **Testing**: Mocking `UnreadCountingStrategy` lets us test unread logic without modifying `Chat` state. We can simulate muted users or priority messages easily, making edge-case testing straightforward.

## Demo Output: See the Magic
When we run the code, we’ll see something like this:
```
=== Sending Messages ===
📱 Push: bob, you were mentioned!
📧 Email (urgent): bob, you have 1 unread messages!
📱 Push: New message in chat 101
📱 Push: New message in chat 101

🔄 Bob turns on notifications
📱 Push: New message in chat 101

Unread counts: {1: 2, 2: 0, 3: 1}
```
- **Alice’s service**: Sends a mention to Bob with `HybridNotificationStrategy` (push + email since unread count hits threshold).
- **Bob’s service**: Silent, no notifications, and no unread count (muted).
- **Charlie’s service**: Only counts important messages (long text from Charlie triggers it).
- **Runtime swap**: Bob switches to `PushNotificationStrategy` and starts getting notifications.

## Key Takeaways: Why Strategy is a Game-Changer
| **Problem** | **Strategy Fix** |
|-------------|------------------|
| Behaviors locked at startup | Swap strategies at runtime without breaking a fucking sweat |
| Notification logic explosion | No need for `PushAndEmailAndSMSNotifier`—compose strategies like a boss |
| Rigid mention extraction | Plug in fuzzy or AI-based parsers like it’s no big deal |
| Dumb unread counting | Customize per user or chat—mute, prioritize, whatever the hell we want |
| Testing nightmares | Inject mock strategies and test without losing our minds |
| OCP violations | Add new strategies without touching core code |

Our SOLID code was like a well-built tank—sturdy but heavy. The Strategy Pattern turns it into a fucking Transformer: same solid core, but now it adapts to any situation. It’s not about rewriting our app—it’s about making it **dynamic** so we can handle:
- **User preferences**: Silence for Bob, push for Charlie, email for admins.
- **Scalability**: Add Slack or WhatsApp notifications without touching `MessageService`.
- **Testing**: Mock strategies make unit tests a walk in the park.
- **Future-proofing**: New requirements (e.g., AI mentions) slot in without breaking shit.

This is how real apps survive the chaos of changing requirements. We’re not just coding—we’re building a system that evolves without making us want to punch a wall.

## What’s Next in Our Design Pattern Saga?
Our WhatsApp clone is now a flexible, scalable beast, but there’s more to conquer:
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Route messages through filters (spam → logger → notifier).
- **Decorator**: Add logging, encryption, or analytics without bloating `MessageService`.
- **Command**: Enable undo/redo for message deletion or queueing for offline users.
- **Observer**: Push real-time updates to the UI for group chats.

The Strategy Pattern isn’t just a fancy trick—it’s how we keep our code from turning into a brittle pile of crap when the real world comes knocking. We’ve gone from a tangled mess to SOLID to **dynamic as fuck**. Let’s keep evolving and not let shitty requirements ruin our clean code.

**Pro Tip**: Use Strategy whenever we see “policies” in our app—notification policies, retry policies, pricing policies. It’s like giving our code a Swiss Army knife for handling bullshit.
